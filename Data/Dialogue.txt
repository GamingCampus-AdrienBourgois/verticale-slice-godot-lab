Hi, do you hear me?
Well, I just wanted to make sure you know what to do here as it's your first day here.
The portal in front of you is broken, Bob set it up wrong.
If you try to use it in its current state, you'll be dragged back here, along with everything in its proximity.
You need to find the cause of the interference, so start by looking around, and when you think all is good, go through the portal.
If you've forgotten something, the portal console will tell you.
Well, I thin k I've told you everything.
END
